A basic programming language that uses binary operators to do everything. Currently supports arithmetic operations, conditionals, lists, user-defined functions, and variable declaration. Order of operations is defined by parenteses (e.g. 2+3\*4 is 2 add (3 mul 4)). Start the interpreter with `py run.py`.

## In Progress:

- Loops
- Clean up code
- Better error handling
- Other data types
- File reading
