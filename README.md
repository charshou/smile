A basic programming language that uses binary operators to do everything. Currently supports arithmetic operations, conditionals, and variable declaration. Order of operations is defined by parenteses (e.g. 2+3*4 is 2 add (3 mul 4)).

## In Progress:

- Loops
- User defined functions
- Better error handling
- Other data types
